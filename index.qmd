::: {#about}

## About Me
I'm a graduate student in the Department of Sociology at the [University of Washington](https://soc.washington.edu/people/brandon-morande){target="_blank"}. My research broadly examines how people experience, navigate, and resist housing inequality in the United States. I also study the intersections between social control, homelessness, and neighborhood change.

I previously worked for a street outreach program in North Carolina, helping people sleeping unsheltered access permanent housing. Prior to this position, I explored peer-based initiatives for people confronting homelessness around the globe.
