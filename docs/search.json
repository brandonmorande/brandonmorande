This study finds that municipal services and the public health system render individuals responsible for housing insecurity by medicalizing poverty as a symptom of psychosocial illness. As an alternative, civil society networks reimagine care as a collective right and site of political mobilization. In addition to field observations, I draw upon interviews with people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, members of civil society organizations, public health providers, and municipal social workers.\n\n\nIndependent Study Project, School for International Training | 2018\n\n\n“Salud callejera: La Atención Primaria de Salud en los márgenes de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires: Redes de cuidado de una organización de la Sociedad Civil para personas en situación de calle”\n\n\nThis study examines how civil society networks facilitate access to primary care for people experiencing homelessness in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Drawing upon interviews and field observations, I also explore how care differs across state services, civil society networks, and peer groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nIndependent Researcher, Washington State Center for Court Research | Present\n\n\n“Legal Financial Obligations in Washington’s Courts\n\n\nI’m helping draft a legislative report examining legal financial obligations across Washington courts. The project also involves quantitative and text data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and writing for public audiences.\n\n\nThomas J. Watson Fellow, Watson Foundation | 2019-2020\n\n\n“The Street Retold: Stories of Homeless Community Empowerment”\n\n\nThis international project explores how peer-based initiatives empower people confronting homelessness to share experiences, develop solidarity, and help one another survive the streets. I also examine how these communities occupy often inaccessible spaces to change perceptions of homelessness. I documented my observations and interviewees’ stories on Instagram, @thestreetretold.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information regarding my undergraduate research and Watson Fellowship, please read this article by Bowdoin College."
