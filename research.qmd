- **Honors Project**, Department of Sociology, Bowdoin College | *2018-2019*

    <details><summary> "Salud Callejera: Mobilizing Cuidado at the Margins of Neoliberalism; Reimagining Care for People Experiencing Homelessness in Buenos Aires"</summary>
    <p>
    My undergraduate [Honors Thesis](https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/113/){target="_blank"} expands upon [prior research](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/2769/){target="_blank"} in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I develop a framework for analyzing care for people experiencing homelessness as a site for both reproducing and resisting neoliberal governance. This study finds that municipal services and the public health system render individuals responsible for housing insecurity by medicalizing poverty as a symptom of psychosocial illness potentially curable through economic and social rehabilitation. As an alternative response, civil society networks reimagine care as a collective right and site of political mobilization. I draw upon interviews with people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, members of civil society organizations, public health providers, and municipal social workers, as well as observations from street-outreach.

    This [project](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/2769/){target="_blank"} examines how civil society networks facilitate access to primary care for people experiencing homelessness in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Drawing upon interviews and field observations, I also explore how care differs across state services, civil society networks, and peer groups.

- **Thomas J. Watson Fellow**, Watson Foundation \| *2019-2020*

    <details><summary>"The Street Retold: Stories of Homeless Community Empowerment"</summary>
    <p>
    I conducted an international [project](https://fellows.watson.foundation/51/fellows/brandon-morande.html){target="_blank"} exploring how peer-based initiatives empower people confronting homelessness to share experiences, develop solidarity, and help one another survive the streets. Specifically, I examined how these communities occupy often inaccessible spaces to change perceptions of homelessness. I documented my observations and interviewees' stories on Instagram, [\@thestreetretold](https://www.instagram.com/thestreetretold/){target="_blank"}.
